considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to

per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

amount of vegetables and fruits that is needed to fulfill the demand for vitamins in our body each vitamin has a specific job low levels of certain vitamins in our body can cause health problems for example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your

of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net

some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

blood cholesterol level then you must avoid having saturated fat in your meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate

which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and leads to an increase in weight to reduce your weight properly you need to adapt to the habit of counting calories and along with it increasing your physical activities you can assess whether you need

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance

this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and leads to an increase in weight to reduce your weight properly you need to adapt to the habit of counting calories and along with it increasing your physical activities you can assess whether you need

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained

contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained through the diet the best way to get enough vitamins is to eat a balanced diet with a variety of food but now a days it is difficult to eat a balanced and healthy diet we often dont eat the right amount of vegetables and fruits that is needed to fulfill the demand for vitamins in our body each vitamin has a specific job low levels of certain vitamins in our body can cause health problems for example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it

contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and leads to an increase in weight to reduce your weight properly you need to adapt to the habit of counting calories and along with it increasing your physical activities you can assess whether you need

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging

the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

amount of vegetables and fruits that is needed to fulfill the demand for vitamins in our body each vitamin has a specific job low levels of certain vitamins in our body can cause health problems for example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may

lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net

slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

worried about your raised blood cholesterol level you must consult with your physician the cholesterol present in food particle is called dietary cholesterol food items such as kidney egg prawns contain more cholesterol content compared to other food article presence of saturated fat in your diet increases the blood cholesterol level even further if your doctor has advised you to reduce your blood cholesterol level then you must avoid having saturated fat in your meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre is of two types watersoluble fibre and water insoluble fibre water soluble fibre tends to get absorbed in your body very well hence it is

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance

effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance

lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if

are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained through the diet the best way to get enough vitamins is to eat a balanced diet with a variety of food but now a days it is difficult to eat a balanced and healthy diet we often dont eat the right amount of vegetables and fruits that is needed to fulfill the demand for vitamins in our body each vitamin has a specific job low levels of certain vitamins in our body can cause health problems for example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre is of two types watersoluble fibre and water insoluble fibre water soluble fibre tends to get absorbed in your body very well hence it is also useful for lowering the blood cholesterol level food rich in water soluble fibre are always try to eat more of these try to eat at least portions of fruits and vegetables daily it has been evidenced that eating food rich in plant sterol and stanol effectively lowers blood cholesterol some food articles like spread and yogurts are rich in sterols and stanols those who wish to reduce their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

amount of vegetables and fruits that is needed to fulfill the demand for vitamins in our body each vitamin has a specific job low levels of certain vitamins in our body can cause health problems for example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any kind of multivitamins extra precaution should be taken before consuming any kind of multivitamins during pregnancy there are essential vitamins that is needed in our body they are vitamins play an important role in cell growth multiplication cell regeneration and digestion vitamins fall into two categories fat soluble and water soluble the fat soluble vitamins a d e and k dissolves in fat and

high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits

you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total

of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their

some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate

per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

blood cholesterol level then you must avoid having saturated fat in your meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre is of two types watersoluble fibre and water insoluble fibre water soluble fibre tends to get absorbed in your body very well hence it is

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and leads to an increase in weight to reduce your weight properly you need to adapt to the habit of counting calories and along with it increasing your physical activities you

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

blood cholesterol level then you must avoid having saturated fat in your meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

their blood cholesterol the above mentioned food are appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance

effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding fried and roasted food and instead having more of steamed microwaved and grilled oilfree food try to have more of fat free meat and skimmed milk and eat less of full fat containing food dietary fibre

appropriate for them people who have a normal blood cholesterol level and children and pregnant woman should not take these food on a regular basis it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you must read the packaging label very well you should also try to avoid overeating or binge eating try to be as active as possible an active life can help you lower your cholesterol level like none other as a part of being active you can go jogging running cycling dancing and exercising it has been seen that doing minutes of aerobic exercise weekly has proven to be beneficial for maintaining the right blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and leads to an increase in weight to reduce your weight properly you need to adapt to the habit of counting calories and along with it increasing your physical activities you can assess whether you need

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins

two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

blood cholesterol level you should practice the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net total energy and calorie is essential if we take more than that we spend our weight is bound to increase the excess calorie accumulates in our body as fat its seen in a research that most of us are taking excess calories and we believe we are working sufficiently enough but actually we are not to maintain a healthy weight we must know the calorie content of individual food articles this helps us keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone

meals it is also necessary to include more fruits vegetables and food high in dietary fibre in your diet plan there are mainly two kinds of fat saturated fat and unsaturated fat saturated fat helps to increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having

the light aerobic exercise the ones that doesnot keep you off from singing during sessions if you are unable to sing during aerobic sessions this means that you are doing moderate level of aerobic if you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

clear picture of uterus use of emergency contraceptive pills in teenagers at maya we understand that the topic of sex education can be considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our body need in small amounts to function properly vitamins can be obtained by eating variety of food and balanced diet which includes different types of vegetables fruits fish and meat we cannot synthesize vitamins in sufficient quantities and therefore it must be obtained

example lack of vitamin c in our body can cause anemia then again high doses of some vitamins can also cause health problems therefore a sound knowledge about vitamins is required before taking any

it may prove to be harmful for them if you have very high cholesterol level and your doctor has advised you to lower the cholesterol level then it would be helpful for you to make certain changes and restrictions in your diet plan rather than having special food to reduce blood cholesterol you should make sure you know about what you are going to eat the fat content in it etc and to do this you

means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to know the exact ratio of energy we intake as food and the amount of energy we lose during activities we must know the amount of calorie in individual food items balance of calorie is the key to a healthy weight we use calorie to measure the total energy content in that individual food item just as we use kilogram to measure the weight of a food item if we wish to lose weight we must have food which are low in calories and we should follow an active lifestyle despite having a nutritious diet one must take a reduced amount of calories to reduce weight effectively you can use the body mass index bmi calculator in our page to check whether you have an appropriate weight for height food and drinks act as a source of energy calorie for our body we use this energy calorie to perform our daily tasks the more we work the more our body needs the energy calorie to maintain a steady weight the amount of energy we take through food and drinks should be equal to the amount of energy we lose physiologically and via daily activities if someday we take in some extra calories we must use that by doing extra work to maintain the balance between the net

keep a check on the balance of our daily calorie intake and output and in this way it makes sure that we do not eat more than what we need many of the food items have the net calorie written in their packaging it is denoted by kcal kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it

considered a taboo by many and therefore discussing morning after pills likely to be even more complex or may even be seen as controversial through our q a tool maya apa over of questions we receive are to do with pregnancy family planning and sex education as a result we feel it is highly important that the women out there many of whom are merely teenagers have more information about morning after pills commonly referred to as i pills whether socially and culturally different forms of sexual activities are acceptable or not men and women will engage in sexual behaviors for people to make the right decisions about their bodies whether it is to practice abstinence or have multiple sexual partners it is imperative for especially young adults to have information about their bodies especially in the bangladeshi context where we are in a paradox of over population yet no conversation on sex education in the households it is important to use print and online platforms to provide these much needed information many of us have memories of parents changing channels when i pills commercial came up as if to avoid is the best strategy but truth is everyone knows of these products and usually the ways in which they find out about contraception are not well researched or thought out from our own research we have seen that due to lack of basic knowledge about pregnancy sexual health and contraceptions many young women use emergency pills as regular contraception without understanding the risks associated our goal is to highlight some of these risks and share information on alternatives to the morning after method what you need to know about the emergency contraceptive pill morning after pill contains levonorgestrel which is a synthetic version of progesterone hormone regular birth control pills contain levonorgestrel but in much lower doses this pill works by keeping your progesterone level artificially high thus delaying or stopping ovulation and preventing implantation of the fertilised egg in your womb lining it is meant for women between years of age but nowadays teenagers are using it because it is so easily available without prescription enough studies are not available that prove there are no side effects of this hormone in teenagers taking high doses of this hormone is however not recommended for a developing reproductive system although there are no major long term side effects of this drug when taken too often it can disrupt your normal cycle remember there is a reason why the hormones rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle morning after pill can be taken more than once during a menstrual cycle but its not a logical choice because frequent overuse can cause irregular menstrual cycle which in turn can affect your fertility if a woman uses only emergency pills for contraception for an entire year her chance of becoming pregnant is per cent whereas with the use of regular contraceptive pills the chance is less than per cent and with hormonal intrauterine device it is less than per cent it doesnt cause abortion if you are already pregnant it is not recommended as a regular method of contraception because of its very high failure rate when taken within hours of unprotected sex it is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within hours its effective and when taken within hours the effectiveness is only who morning after pills can be taken as a backup method when there is a contraceptive failure such as torn condom or missed pills unprotected or forced sex some common side effects are nausea vomiting headaches lower abdominal pain and breast tenderness it is a good idea to take an anti emetic medicine that prevents vomiting two hours before you take the pill there are may be unexpected vaginal bleeding your period may come early or may be delayed but if your period is delayed by more than a week a pregnancy test must be done emergency contraceptive pills do not cause abortion if you have a missed period repeating doses will not help but if the pregnancy is continued no birth defects have been reports so far there are rumours that overuse of post coital pills causes infertility but studies done so far have failed to prove any such side effect vitamins different types of vitamins are an essential part of our everyday diet vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that our

increase the blood cholesterol level and unfortunately this is the kind of fat we take more in our diet the food articles that contain saturated fat are unsaturated fat helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level we must try to have more unsaturated fat in our diet rather than the saturated fat here is a list of food that are high in unsaturated fat trans fats are also responsible for increasing the blood cholesterol level it can be found in small amounts in meat and milk products processed food such as cake and biscuits contain hydrogenated fat which makes them rich in artificial trans fat for maintaining a nutritious diet its important to avoid trans fat and saturated fat and have more of unsaturated fat cut off the amount of fat in your daily diet you can do this by avoiding

you have any further health related query then feel free to ask maya apa you must be logged in to post a comment know your body type we all know bmi is the means to evaluate our state of health to make it easier for you to evaluate maya website has got its own bmi calculator whether you have good fitness depends on your bmi value if the bmi value is within the normal range it suggests you are fit and if not then it means you have excess fat present in your body however bmi only offers you the partial image your body shape plays a significant role in this case is it an apple shape or pear shape measure the circumference of your waist at the level of the umbilicus and the circumference of the hips now divide the quantity of the waists circumference by the quantity of the hips circumference in case of females if the result ranges from or above than that this means there is accumulation of excess fat around your waist thus you have an apple shaped body if the result of the division falls below in that case the conclusion is you have excess weight above your knees and around your hips relatively indicating you have a pear shaped body excess belly fat amplifies the chances of cardiac diseases diabetes and kidney diseases these fat reside in the membrane like structures called omentum present in parts of the stomach abdominal organs from here these fat can easily migrate to liver and other parts of the body if your pant slips off your waist or your belly sticks out of your pant and hangs this means your waist is heavier than your upper below portion of the waist on the other hand you have a good news people with apple shaped physique can easily reduce weight it is easier to diminish these than the solid fat of the hips and upper section of the knees cardiovascular exercises are perfect for apple shaped bodies this accelerates your heartbeat and sheds off the injurious fat walking jogging swimming and climbing stairs are the best types of exercise in this case doing squats to drop the fat of a specific part of the body will not burn the surplus fat and will not improve the status of your heart rather may cause back pain now comes the diet what you should do is to increase the uptake of brown rice and brown flour mainly food that are rich in complex carbohydrates and fibers these rapidly raises the blood sugar level instead of providing energy to the body which is why you feel less hungry these body shapes have excess fat dwelling near the subcutaneous tissues present above their knees and hips precisely the thighs this condition is also known as gynoid obesity females in this structure having wider pelvis have extra advantages during pregnancy and delivery of the baby the probabilities of chronic diseases are also fewer with people having this structure be that as it may the additional fat puts extra pressure on the knees and may lead to osteoporosis if wearing pants of the correct size gets stuck near the hips then that means you have a pear shaped body although additional subcutaneous fat is better than belly fat it still retards the blood flow and is difficult to get rid of the best exercise option for these individuals are the resistance training comprising of squats push ups one sided rowing and diagonal crunches each of the exercise should be done for times without any break if you do take a break then that has to be a momentary one before you start the next exercise it is highly important to warm up your body prior to the exercise and cool down yourself after you are done with the exercise the likelihood of gaining excess fat seems to be more in pear shaped body rather than apple shaped ones which is why you have to raise the uptake of fibers and lower the amount of fatty foods in your diet fibers link with the fats and gets eliminated from the body you can put off weight tone down but simply cannot change your body structure it is better to know your body structure and take appropriate actions for that than getting carried away by the trending diet plans you must be logged in to post a comment health calorie calorie is defined as the unit of total energy contained within food to

kilocalorie or kj kilojoule the word calorie and kilocalorie are synonymous kilocalorie equals calories kilojoule is another metric of assessment of energy to obtain energy in kilojoules one needs to multiply calorie x normally the nutrition label in the packet is measured per g food or per g drink so that the calorie of different food items can be compared easily some labels also indicate calorie per unit of food but please try to remember that calorie measurements of the manufacturers might not be same as that of yours and for this reason you might be having slightly more calories than you are supposed to to understand how much calorie is suitable for you use the calorie count information for eg to maintain an idle weight an adult man needs kcals kj on an average and an adult woman needs kcals kj of energy the amount of calorie used depends on the amount of work that is done by an individual but it also depends on other factors like the shape of your body and the current weight the more active you are the more calories you need to use for eg running fast uses up much more calorie than walking slowly if you consume calories more than you spend it gets converted into fat and

for about another weeks the is forming and partly functional you your body is working hard to prepare itself to support a life that will be growing in it you may feel tired your breasts may feel slightly swollen and tender you may have noticed that you are too after implantation your body is releasing copious amounts of beta hcg hormones which is responsible for the early pregnancy symptoms

begood for your health if its done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment during winter sometimes its not enough to use body lotion

after almost years i wasnt very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and pressure you can spend this time reading a quran or praying or watching a tv serial or cooking show or talking to a friend dont hesitate to make time for yourself because you owe this much for yourself forget about all the worries and tension take a deep breath and relax you

foremost priority so if you are spending only one hour in the gym and aiming for a perfect shape soon you will lose your interest for exercising these are the best ways to beat the exercise excuses do you have one dont forget to share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for our society by our actions having healthy nails isnt just important for beauty reasons its also an indicator of good health proper care can keep your

building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters such as severe floods earthquakes or tsunamis it should be kept in mind that ptsd is not usually related to situations that are simply upsetting such as divorce job loss or failing exams bangladesh being a disaster prone country makes ptsd a relevant concern terrifying events occur frequently these range from natural calamities like cyclones and floods to disasters such as factory fires and building collapses that have plagued the textiles industry in the aftermath of the horrific rana plaza collapse back in april it appears that many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate

done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment during winter sometimes its not enough to use body lotion only the skin may

very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and pressure you can spend this time reading a quran or praying or watching a tv serial or cooking

share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for

to what they have to say allow them to recount their harrowing experience as much as possible try to be non judgmental during panic attacks try to give them physical space so as to not trigger the experience through touch experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd ptsd is a mental health condition or anxiety disorder that occurs following a frightening stressful or traumatic experience it can occur immediately after the troubling event or even weeks months or years after here are a few of the many causes of ptsd serious road accidents surviving natural or man made disasters floods cyclones and in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters such as severe floods earthquakes or tsunamis it should be kept in mind that ptsd is not usually related to situations that are simply upsetting such as divorce job loss or failing exams bangladesh being a disaster prone country makes ptsd a relevant concern terrifying events occur frequently these range from natural calamities like cyclones and floods to disasters such as factory fires and building collapses that have plagued the textiles industry in the aftermath of the horrific rana plaza collapse back in april it appears that many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate treatment at the right time has shown great success and complete recovery in most people the treatment plan involves psychotherapy and medication psychotherapy is usually recommended first but if symptoms are severe both forms of treatment are used after an initial assessment of the severity of symptoms which is done to ensure that the treatment is tailor made for the persons needs a ptsd patient is referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist the following are a few methods employed in the treatment watchful waiting this is used if the person has mild symptoms or has had symptoms for less than weeks it involves careful monitoring of symptoms over a period of a few weeks to see if they get better or worse the reason this is used is that several people with mild symptoms have gotten better without treatment within a few weeks psychotherapy the trained mental health professional listens to all that the person has to say and helps come up with strategies to solve the problem types of psychotherapy used are cognitive behavioural therapy cbt the person is helped to change the way they think and act to better cope with the traumatic event each session is usually minutes long lasting for months eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr it involves making side to side movements of the eyeball usually by following the movement of the therapists finger while recalling the traumatic incident it is said to help the hippocampus better process flashbacks and memories regarding the event medication antidepressants such as paroxetine mirtazapine amitriptyline or phenelzine are occasionally used to treat adults with ptsd however these medications will only be used if one chooses not to have trauma focused psychological treatment psychological treatment would not be effective because there is an ongoing threat of further trauma such as domestic violence little or no benefit from a course of trauma focused psychological treatment underlying medical condition such as severe depression that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment if medication for ptsd is effective it will usually be continued for a minimum of months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer treatment with

touch the first step that a person afflicted with ptsd can take to better his her condition is to seek and ask for help since talking about the traumatic experience can treat some aspects of ptsd this help can be taken from a close friend or relative however in order to ensure complete recovery it is recommended that the help is taken from a mental health professional even though mental health issues are a source of shame for those suffering from them in bangladesh there are two renowned institutions where one can receive all forms of treatment required to recover from ptsd national

sajidafoundation org fastingduring the month of ramadan can begood for your health if its done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment

be used you must be logged in to post a comment although i met shanta after almost years i wasnt very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and

these are the best ways to beat the exercise excuses do you have one dont forget to share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for our society by our actions having healthy nails isnt just important for beauty reasons its also an indicator

combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters such as severe floods earthquakes or tsunamis it should be kept in mind that ptsd is not usually related to situations that are simply upsetting such as divorce job loss or failing exams bangladesh being a disaster prone country makes ptsd a relevant concern terrifying events occur frequently these range from natural calamities like cyclones and floods to disasters such as factory fires and building collapses that have plagued the textiles industry in the aftermath of the horrific rana plaza collapse back in april it appears that many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate

done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment during winter sometimes its not enough to use body lotion only the skin may

very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they

share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for

to what they have to say allow them to recount their harrowing experience as much as possible try to be non judgmental during panic attacks try to give them physical space so as to not trigger the experience through touch experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd ptsd is a mental health condition or anxiety disorder that occurs following a frightening stressful or traumatic experience it can occur immediately after the troubling event or even weeks months or years after here are a few of the many causes of ptsd serious road accidents surviving natural or man made disasters floods cyclones and in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters such as severe floods earthquakes or tsunamis it should be kept in mind that ptsd is not usually related to situations that are simply upsetting such as divorce job loss or failing exams bangladesh being a disaster prone country makes ptsd a relevant concern terrifying events occur frequently these range from natural calamities like cyclones and floods to disasters such as factory fires and building collapses that have plagued the textiles industry in the aftermath of the horrific rana plaza collapse back in april it appears that many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate treatment at the right time has shown great success and complete recovery in most people the treatment

touch the first step that a person afflicted with ptsd can take to better his her condition is to seek and ask for help since talking about the traumatic experience can treat some aspects of ptsd this

sajidafoundation org fastingduring the month of ramadan can begood for your health if its done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment

be used you must be logged in to post a comment although i met shanta after almost years i wasnt very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and

these are the best ways to beat the exercise excuses do you have one dont forget to share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for our society by our actions having healthy nails isnt just important for beauty reasons its also an indicator

many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate

done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment during winter sometimes its not enough to use body lotion only the skin may

very glad after seeing her i have always wondered if shanta was still very lively as she used to be but i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and pressure you can spend this time reading a quran or praying or watching a tv serial or cooking show or talking to a friend dont hesitate to make time for yourself because you owe this much for yourself forget about all the worries and tension take a deep breath and relax you must be logged in

share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for our society by our actions having healthy nails isnt just important for beauty reasons its also an indicator of good health proper care can keep your nails healthy and strong but if your nails are

few methods employed in the treatment watchful waiting this is used if the person has mild symptoms or has had symptoms for less than weeks it involves careful monitoring of symptoms over a period of

is helped to change the way they think and act to better cope with the traumatic event each session is usually minutes long lasting for months eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr it involves making side to side movements of the eyeball usually by following the movement of the therapists finger while recalling the traumatic incident it is said to help the hippocampus better process flashbacks and memories regarding the event medication antidepressants such as paroxetine mirtazapine amitriptyline or phenelzine are occasionally used to treat adults with ptsd however these medications will only be used if one chooses not to have trauma focused psychological treatment psychological treatment would not be effective because there is an ongoing threat of further trauma such as domestic violence little or no benefit from a course of trauma focused psychological treatment underlying medical condition such as severe depression that significantly affects your ability to

heavily stigmatized in bangladesh people with such afflictions are shunned from society thus making their situation even more difficult than it already is as a friend or relative of a person suffering from ptsd we could do the following to give them a helping hand encourage them to seek psychiatric help treatment based on psychotherapy and medication could go a long way to solving the issue listen to what they have to say allow them to recount their harrowing experience as much as possible try to be non judgmental during panic attacks try to give them physical space so as to not trigger the experience through touch experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd ptsd is a mental health condition or anxiety disorder that occurs following a frightening stressful or traumatic experience it can occur immediately after the troubling event or even weeks months or years after here are a few of the many causes of ptsd serious road accidents surviving natural or man made disasters floods cyclones and in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters such as severe floods earthquakes or tsunamis it should be kept in mind that ptsd is not usually related to situations that are simply upsetting such as divorce job loss or failing exams bangladesh being a disaster prone country makes ptsd a relevant concern terrifying events occur frequently these range from natural calamities like cyclones and floods to disasters such as factory fires and building collapses that have plagued the textiles industry in the aftermath of the horrific rana plaza collapse back in april it appears that many of the survivors and rescue workers have suffered or are suffering from ptsd with the recent political instability in the country the unfortunate victims of arson attacks are also prone to suffer from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated with such illnesses for this reason we should all make ourselves aware of this condition and do our part as a community to help those who are encumbered by this mental affliction experiencing a traumatic event or witnessing something distressing is unfortunately very common in ones life especially in a disaster prone and resource constrained country like bangladesh after any distressful event a person will experience symptoms of grief and stress for some time it is part of the natural grieving process within a few weeks depending on how traumatic the experience was these symptoms tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate treatment at the right time has shown great success and complete recovery in most people the treatment

touch the first step that a person afflicted with ptsd can take to better his her condition is to seek and ask for help since talking about the traumatic experience can treat some aspects of ptsd this help can be taken from a close friend or relative however in order to ensure complete recovery it is recommended that the help is taken from a mental health professional even though mental health issues are a source of shame for those suffering from them in bangladesh there are two renowned institutions where one can receive all forms of treatment required to recover from ptsd national

sajidafoundation org fastingduring the month of ramadan can begood for your health if its done correctly when the body is starved of food it starts to burn fat so that it can make energy this can lead to weight loss however if you fast for too longyour body will eventually start breaking down muscle protein for energy which isunhealthy dr razeen mahroof an anaesthetist from oxford says theres a strong relationship between diet and health ramadan isnt always thought of as being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than the health aspect he says however its a great chance to get the physical benefits as well the changes that happen in the body during a fast depend on the length of the continuous fast the body enters into a fasting state eight hours or so after the last meal when the gut finishes absorbing nutrients from the food in the normal state body glucose which is stored in the liver and muscles is the bodys main source of energy during a fast this store of glucose is used up first to provide energy later in the fast once theglucose runs out fat becomes the nextsource of energy for the body with a prolonged fast of many days or weeks the body starts usingprotein for energy this is the technical description of what is commonly known as starvation it is clearly unhealthy and involves protein being released by the breakdown of muscle which is why people who starve look very thin and become extremely weak however you are unlikely to reach the starvation stage during ramadan because the fast is broken daily as the ramadan fast only lasts from dawn till dusk the bodys energy can be replaced in thepre dawn and dusk meals this provides agentle transition from using glucose as the main source of energy to using fat and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein dr mahroof says the use of fat for energy helps weight loss it preserves the muscles and eventually reduces your cholesterol level in addition weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure after a few days of the fast higher levels of endorphins appear in the blood making you more alert and givingan overall feeling of general mental wellbeing a balanced food and fluid intake is important between fasts the kidneys are very efficient at maintaining the bodys water and salts such as sodium and potassium however these can be lost through perspiration to prevent muscle breakdown meals must contain enough energy food such as carbohydrates and some fat the way to approach your diet during fasting is similar to the way you should be eating outside ramadan says dr mahroof you should have a balanced diet with the rightproportionof carbohydrate fat and protein you must be logged in to post a comment

i noticed that a lot has changed she looked very tired and had dark circles around her eyes and most of the time she was screaming at her two kids one year old and another year old while talking to her i came to know that it was being very difficult for her to manage the kids while fasting she had to do a lot of work drop her kids at school take them back home prepare food for them prepare iftar wash clothes and dishes etc so i thought of some ways by which fasting mothers can also keep their kids healthy and happy during the month of ramadan sleep well sleep is an important part of our life a lot of thing has to be done during ramadan so it becomes very difficult to sleep for hours you are busy with works like going to iftar parties praying namaz preparing food eating sehri etc i realized after seeing my mother that how difficult it can be to wake up at the sehri all these things make you feel tired and you easily become angry that is why you should sleep as much as you can you should try and take a nap at noon so that you can carry on with the rest of the day make a list of your work try to make use of most of your time dont start making iftar right before the iftar time otherwise it might seem you are running out of time and this might affect your behavior with your kids make separate time for your work and for your kids try to know your limits relax stay calm and avoid doing works like cleaning your room or arranging your wardrobe at this time you should realize you have some limits and lack of energy so try and avoid doing any extra work during this time if you are constantly under pressure you will become more impatient have fun with your kids make sometime for doing things that your kids like for example reading stories to them drawing or making something creative with them the more you can keep your kids busy with these things the less they will try to seek your attention try and make something delicious for your kids at iftar i have seen my sister use this idea at iftar she prepares all those foods which my niece likes so at that time my niece tries not to disturb her mother she reads or plays by herself while her mother cooks chocolate pudding or spaghetti for her dont forget to make some time for yourself you need to have some time for yourself in order to boost up your energy this will help you get rid of all your tension and

these are the best ways to beat the exercise excuses do you have one dont forget to share with us on you must be logged in to post a comment talking about our physical outlook is almost a standard normative wherever we go whomever we meet there is some talk about how we are looking today tired fresh fat skinny dark fair happy depressed the list goes on from booming advertisements telling us to look a certain way to friends and family having certain expectations of the way we are to be seen projected in the larger society soon we start internalizing these images that we have to look and feel a certain way to be accepted to find happiness while positive body image can boost our confidence negative body image which is an abundance of can lead to eating disorders emotional breakdown and overall unhealthy living so the question is do we never tell a friend if she is gorging on too many sweets or do we never tell a brother about his unkempt ways is talking about body image always negative can we promote positive body image without causing unhealthy lifestyle filled with diet pills and skin lightening products can we find a way to accept all body types while promoting healthy living one of our biggest problem is that we never think of ourselves as perfect it is said that even the people who have millions of fans because of their beauty feel this yet we strive all the time to make ourselves perfect and that is why instead of being concerned about good health we are far more concerned about our physical appearance and skin colour some people feel that they are too fair others feel they are too dark some think they are too tall while others believe themselves to be too short thus the various aspects of our physical appearance cause numerous grievances to accumulate in our minds these grievances then eventually push us towards physical and mental illnesses that is because at one point we start to think and worry about our appearance and image more and with that comes a change in our eating pattern as well as a change in our thought process all these changes usually bring about an adverse effect in a persons lives one of the major negative effects of this change is the emergence of eating disorders eating disorders are a kind of mental illness that is also a disease one of the main types of this disease is anorexia the person affected by it gradually decreases the portion of the food they eat until at one point they start suffering from anorexia after a while the person becomes so obsessed with their food habit and weight that they become physically and mentally weak if this condition is not treated changes in behaviour physical illnesses appear in due time however it still remains a question why does this problem originate in the first place even at the threshold of the twenty first century there still remains some beliefs in our society that just cannot be accepted as normal it is hard to believe that in this day and age a girls eligibility for marriage is still judged by her physical appearance although she might be qualified in every other way on the other hand for the girls whom society deem as beautiful their reward for being so is that they get married off early society rarely considers the fact that besides being an entity with a physical appearance a girl might exist as her own person might have the ability to do something even now society gives priority to physical appearance not the qualities of the person inside not their talents maybe that is why we have such big headaches and worries about our physical appearance we are still far away from understanding the truth that a person can prove themselves by expressing their talents and not by taking health risks for their external beauty it must be noted that the media has played a very big hand in helping these ideas to prevail in society many of these advertisements that are shown in media mainly center around a persons physical appearance in these ads someone is praised and another is portrayed in a mocking manner this in one way can be categorized as a violation of human rights but we have gotten used to seeing this and seem to derive amusement from following these practices before we make fun of someones different physical attributes we do not deem it necessary to pause and think if there is a cause behind it or what might be the consequences of our actions we completely forget what a bleak future we are warranting for our society by our actions having healthy nails isnt just important for beauty reasons its also an indicator

from the condition unfortunately like in many other nations mental illness is a major stigma in bangladesh often times it reaches such levels that it is considered taboo to speak of or be associated

tend to disappear unfortunately some people have trouble coming to terms with the trauma and they end up suffering from the symptoms for a prolonged time when these symptoms of stress brought on by trauma persist longer than usual it is called post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd the symptoms of ptsd can hamper a persons daily life and activities these usually appear within a month of the trauma or as mentioned previously may take several months or years to appear some individuals experience symptoms on an on and off basis meaning they will feel bad at certain periods and will feel fine at most other times there are some who experience the symptoms constantly the symptoms vary widely from person to person but can be generally be categorized in the following manner re experiencing this is the most common symptom amongst sufferers of ptsd it entails involuntarily and vividly re living the trauma by means of flashbacks nightmares or distressing images and sensations the re experience can be triggered by certain reminders of the trauma such as in case of rape the smell of their rapist cologne rape jokes sexually violent scenes on tv etc it also leaves the sufferer wondering why the event happened and whether they could have done anything to prevent it also with feelings of guilt or shame some people also have physical manifestations such as pain sweating trembling etc panic attacks these are characterized by attacks of intense anxiety where the person hyperventilates trembles becomes nauseous sweats or experiences chest pain re experiencing and panic attacks often occur together avoidance and emotional numbing this is a very common finding amongst people suffering from ptsd it involves trying to avoid factors that would make the person relive the event avoiding people places or conversations related to the event is common people suffering from ptsd often to try not feel anything at all this sort of emotional numbing can lead to a person becoming isolated and withdrawn or results in them giving up activities that would previously bring them pleasure hyper arousal sufferers of ptsd are often found to be in a state of anxiousness find it difficult to relax or in a sate of constant vigilance this is characterized by being easily startled always feeling stressed having regular headaches insomnia irritability sudden weeping sudden outbursts of anger etc being in this state of hyper arousal can significantly affect a persons daily activities as well relationships with people in their lives others people with ptsd may also suffer from depression anxiety phobias drug or alcohol misuse symptoms in children children like adults can also suffer from ptsd most symptoms have been found to be the same amongst children and adults these include insomnia upsetting nightmares losing interest in previously enjoyed activities physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches are also common however the following are a few symptoms that are specific to children bedwetting being unusually anxious or afraid about being separated from a parent re enacting the traumatic event through their play ptsd occurs after experiencing or even witnessing a traumatic event the following are a few of the many possible causes serious road accidents surviving natural floods cyclones tsunamis or man made disasters in case of bangladesh incidents of building collapsing and political turmoil violent personal assaults such as sexual assault mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks the condition is said to develop in around in people who experience trauma although the precise mechanism as to why ptsd develops is uncertain there are certain theories certain precipitating factors seem to be involved these include pre existing depression anxiety unsupportive family members or sometimes even a genetic predisposition appears to be linked the theories are explained below survival mechanism it is thought that the symptoms of ptsd are a means of helping the individual coping with the experience and be better prepared for future re occurrances for example the flashbacks help people remember every detail of the event so that they are better prepared if it happens again and the state of hyper arousal is thought to help the person react quicker unfortunately these so called coping mechanisms serve as a hindrance to the person being able to process and move on from the experience elevated adrenaline levels when faced with danger the body produces the hormone adrenaline that triggers a fight or flight response in the body which helps to dull pain and the senses it is thought that people with ptsd have higher levels of this hormone since it is secreted even when there is no danger as a result people suffer from emotional numbing and the hyper aroused state changes in the brain studies have shown that people with ptsd have an abnormality with the hippocampus the part of the brain involved in emotional processing brain scans have revealed that these people have a hippocampus that is smaller in size the poorly functioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and memories from being properly processed so the anxieties sufferers generate do not reduce over time ptsd is a very treatable condition and appropriate

real name he was very charming and was always sending me cards it seemed odd but he explained it was because he liked watching me in hindsight i realise he did it so he could see what i was wearing before long he started asking why i bothered putting on make up he told me that i was beautiful and perfect without it then he began laying out my clothes for me it was his way of being able to choose what i wore name calling then violence after two months he began to wait for me outside work if i didnt come out immediately hed get angry he accused me of staying late so i could flirt with other men he said that he only waited because he loved me he became moody and would start rows hed call me names and mock my accent a little voice in the back of my head kept saying youre not happy but i tried to ignore it i always seemed to be on the phone to golam explaining what i was doing even though i was sometimes up at am for my job he expected his dinner to be on the table when he came in from work gradually he became the most important thing in my life the only thing in my life i had less and less contact with family and friends one day when we were bickering golam pushed me onto the floor finally i stood up to him and told him he couldnt treat me that way that people go to prison for behaving like that he laughed called me a liability then rang the police he told them that we had been having a row and i was planning to call them the next day to say he had hit me so as to cause trouble for him i felt really scared as id never been in that situation before i was embarrassed and shocked and didnt know what to do hitting spitting humiliation after this incident the violence became a regular occurrence in our relationship one time he broke my finger and i had to see a hand specialist on another occasion i went to emergency with bruising to my head face and body he spat at me pushed me kicked me and bit me once he even tried to run me over after each bout of violence he would tenderly rub cream on my skin and tell me he was my protector i began to feel that i was going mad the degradation was harder to cope with than the violence i became so insecure and unsure of what was right or wrong by my own standards never mind legally that i allowed many things to happen that i never would have before golam would make me beg on my knees if i wanted something or hed throw money on the pavement and order me to pick it up leaving and regaining confidence i became convinced i was ugly when we went out golam would blatantly stare at women in front of me then if i complained tell me that i was imagining it bit by bit my sense of reason and self esteem evaporated he became more and more controlling he even told my mum to contact me only through his mobile because it was easier each night he would search my bag and check the mileage on my car he would take pictures of me as i was walking around the house or when i was sobbing after an argument i finally left golam after he attacked me with a corkscrew it took me a long time to build up my confidence again especially as he continued to harass me long after i left him he had completely crushed my self worth my career as a teacher which had been going from strength to strength before i met him really suffered with the support of my friends family i was able to rebuild my life and confidence i have worked hard to get back on track and im doing really well at work now most importantly i know my own mind again this unfortunately is not a unique story this unfortunately is not a made up story this story resonates with innumerable women in bangladesh both in urban and rural areas rich or poor educated or socially vulnerable whos multi country study on womens health and domestic violence against women shows that more than percent of women in urban areas of bangladesh have been subjected to intimate partner violence ipv intimate partner violence has been directly shown to result to systematic and recurrent physical abuse which leads to severe emotional distress depression and suicidal behavior there are several instances of ipv occurring during womens pregnancies or post antenatal stages causing further physical and emotional harm to both mother and child ipv in bangladesh is usually seen through the focus of domestic violence which does not usually take into consideration instances of young couples in consenting relationships and therefore the abuse and violence that occurs in these relations there is also far greater stigma around young women and girls in relationships before marriage which leads to silencing of any form of abuse that may happen among partners anyone who has been sexually assaulted or abused by their partners can get confidential help treatment and support

comment child marriage is a serious issue in south asia and particularly in bangladesh which has the highest rate in this region over one third of women aged between were married by the age of and were married before the age of bbs report on vaw this is not just a systematic violation of womens rights but it is also a huge obstacle to economic and human development in bangladesh girls are often married off early with the aim of minimising dowry costs moreover parents often believe that early marriage will protect their daughters from sexual harassment a belief for which there is absolutely no evidence the consequences are devastating and manifold girls who marry early generally drop out of school which instantly reduces their economic independence and restricts their social status and mobility lack of education also affects their health and that of their children as children of educated mothers are less likely to suffer from malnutrition girls who marry as children are susceptible to a myriad of health risks due to other reasons too they tend to experience early sexual initiation and childbearing which expose them to many physical problems including fistula sexually transmitted diseases and complications at birth they are also more likely to experience domestic violence and rape with the associated psychological implications child marriage is not simply a violation of the individual rights of women it also reflects and perpetuates a culture where women are constantly undervalued treated as sexual objects and denied any sort of power over their own lives the problem is that by taking women out of school so early on they are kept uneducated uninformed about their rights and thus powerless and when they have their own daughters these women are often active participants in continuing the trend and encouraging them to marry early to break this cycle it is important that women have access to information and that they receive support to make their own free empowered decisions this is not to say that men dont play an important role in the fight for equal rights but once women are aware and sensitized about this issue they will support their daughters in making their own decisions too gradually breaking the cycle when reshma from a rural village called harirampur found out at that she was going to be married off to a year old man from a nearby village she was devastated and begged her father to change his mind it was not after reshmas mother began mobilising villagers and local stakeholders in the community that reshmas father gave in finally understanding that child marriage is illegal and unfair reshmas mother had become aware about the dangers of child marriage by being a member of a reflective action group organised by actionaid through this group she learnt information about child marriage and she built a network with other women who supported her as she defended her daughters rights child marriage is a threat to bangladeshi society in many fronts it has been illegal since but this has done nothing to stop it the only way to break the cycle is to raise awareness about the dangers of the practice and to empower women to make their own considered decisions through providing accessible information to both online and offline communities and mobilising a network of women for collective action and support despite the minimum age of girls to get married being in every girl in a developing country is married before her th birthday there are multiple reasons for such a high rate of child marriage in bangladesh strong unchallenged patriarchal norms many parents think that marrying off their daughters early would mean less dowry as the dowry increases with the girls ages by finding an appropriate groom they believe they are securing their childs future but they completely ignore the emotional and psychological effects these have in the wellbeing of the girl although there has been a decline in child marriage stats over the past decades the rate is slow and issues are still not addressed properly child marriage denies a girl of her right to education and the ability to have an economic stability it disconnects them with their family and leaves them to deal with marriage parenthood and domestic duties alone they do not have any control over their choices and are more subjected to domestic violence since the male partner usually much older than the girl dominates the family he is responsible for making the decisions on behalf the girl is deprived of her sexual and reproductive rights most of the girls married before years of age describe their first sexual experience as forced if she gets pregnant the decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy is taken by her husband or other members of the family she is also deprived of her rights to contraception and family planning the husband decides the form of contraception used and in case of unwanted pregnancy unsafe unhygienic methods are applied to terminate pregnancy without any professional medical advice or supervision at maya apa ki bolen we get questions where a years old has carried out abortion at home twice since she got married at the age of because her family believed she isnt ready for childbirth child marriage also puts the girl at risk of a early pregnancy at a time when her body is still not prepared to go through childbearing there are continuous pregnancies without much gap between two childbirths in a country such as bangladesh where undernutrition is a huge problem these underweight teenage girls are unable to go through childbirth without facing pregnancy related complications young teenage girls are more likely to die of pregnancy related causes than girls who are pregnant in their s early child bearing means she suffers from conditions such as iron deficiency anaemia high blood pressure pre eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and depression the mortality is higher during childbirth when they have to go through labour upto of adolescent mothers suffer from obstetric fistula as a complication of normal labour early childbearing is also related to the high maternal mortality rate there is a much higher chance of perinatal and infant mortality stillbirth preterm births and birth of low weight babies the babies are undernourished more vulnerable to diseases and die within first month of birth even the baby survives there is delayed development of milestones lack of basic education means that the mother is unaware of child nutrition and babycare addressing these issues and raising awareness against child marriage can help us fight maternal and child mortality it is not about educating the girls but families and society as a whole the law that binds upon the religion islam is shariah law it prescribes muslim behavior in every aspect of life from private matters between the individual and god to relationships with others from the family or the widest community the law is casted from the actions and words of the quran the holy book sunnah what is said by prophet mohammad sbh ijma communal legislation made by great scholars and qiyas permissible exegesis the shariah contains categories and subjects of islamic law called the branches of fiqh literally understanding they include islamic worship family relations inheritance commerce property law civil tort law criminal law administration taxation constitution international relations war and ethics and other categories in order to protect womens right several laws also exist and some have been enacted in our country but no law contradict with the shariah first of all we should go through the article of the constitution of the peoples republic of bangladesh where it has very clearly stated that women shall have equal right with men in all spheres of state and of public life and it has again stated in that nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of society so it is clear that womens right have been guaranteed by our constitution though in muslim family law ordinance or in other law womens rights have been guaranteed but there are some problems arising at the time of enforcement it is a very important question that after enacting some laws in order to protect the rights of women whether women can implement their rights there are many reports pointing out that women often face difficulty in pursuing their rights within the legal system due to the lack of implementation of laws against murder rape assault child marriage and many other abuses social norms tend to ostracize female victims rather than perpetrators of crimes i would like to emphasize the important issue of registration we often miss out during the whole shenanigans during and after marriage this one act decides whether or not the woman in the marriage will likely get any recourse from law if and when she needs it it has clearly been stated in section of the muslim marriages and divorces registration act that notwithstanding anything contained in any law custom or usage every marriage solemnized under muslim law shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of this act inspite of this mandatory legal requirement huge number of marriages are solemnizing without any registration in the city as well as in the rural areas as a result if any dispute arises in their conjugal life women cannot go to the court for implementing her right since the marriage was not duly registered on the other hand many marriages are being conducted court where as there is no such marriage like court marriage court marriage is nothing except a form of an affidavit where both parties sign and agree to marry each other after swearing the affidavit many of the couple do not register their marriage in order to save their money again when the right of the woman is violated and she has no other alternative but to seek help from the court she cannot enforce her eight due to failure of registration all our readers are advised to ensure that they have their contract of marriage registered buy one saree less or invite fewer people if money is a constraint but do not fail to register your kabin nama or deed of marriage written by barrister tasnuva shelley advocate supreme court of bangladesh

sexual assault referral centre speak on anonymously if you feel you are in a situation like this with less tolerance for domestic violence nowadays what was legally acceptable behaviour in the past is now no longer permissible in law in most developed countries after being encouraged by patriarchy for millennia to mistreat women men are now expected to change their oppressive behaviour almost overnight with little support for change from the state luke daniels domestic violence consultant and author of pulling the punches defeating domestic violence the root cause of men abusing women can be linked to the primitive instinct of men to prove that he is stronger than women the world has followed a patriarch system from the beginning of time men are physically stronger than women so they should go out to work while the vulnerable and fragile women must stay at home nursing kids and taking care of the household this unfortunately remains the premise in strong patriarchal societies such as that in bangladesh a boy is taught that he is superior than a girl at a very early age he almost always gets a special treatment compared to his sister he is called a girl whenever he shows any weakness or emotion this gives the boy only one lesson that a girl is weak being a girl is a matter of joke be made fun of that girls are always beneath boys these ideas of masculinity and femininity continues throughout adulthood where relationships between husband and wife are also dictated by these notions of what a woman is suppose to do and should be doing compounded with socio cultural beliefs and sayings that in many instances are not necessarily religiously sound but claimed to be from religious referrals women are made to believe and are therefore treated as the weaker sex the second class citizen a new done specifically on men of asia and the pacifics have stated that education and awareness on gender equality is an effective way of stopping violence against women interviewing over men at various sites of bangladesh sri lanka indonesia china has revealed several factors that came up repeatedly as to why men abuse women it showed that abusive men try to control their partner in every possible way believe in male superiority over female like to show off their male toughness and sexuality have grown up seeing abuse of women esp mother as a normal occurrence have a history of abuse be it physical mental or sexual to stop abuse we need to be encouraging men to participate and be pro actively engaged in womens rights to stand up and fight for women there is a great fear by men and boys that to get involved in womens rights somehow reduces their masculinity and makes them appear emotional weak or feminine these perceptions need to be changed men also need to be shown that they do not need to be scared of empowered or educated women or womens equality in general ensuring greater empowerment and education of girls and women are not threats but opportunities for both the sexes in a patriarchal society men are used to being in control and the release of that control and hence realizing the unknown makes many men very uneasy this needs to be eliminated to prevent violence against women the study recommends making violence against women totally unacceptable eg through awareness programmes using socially recognized and influential people like actors cricketers etc educate men about ways to show their musculinity other than abusing women eg through sustained school based or sports based education programmes address child abuse and promote healthy families eg through parenting programmes comprehensive child protection systems and policies work with young people with a particular focus on boys and adolescents to understand consent and healthy sex respectful relationships end immunity for men who use violence against women particularly marital rape through criminalization of all forms of violence against women and ensure fast legal action to ensure effective access to justice and ensure the full empowerment of women and girls and eliminate gender discrimination another important agenda that must be looked into is the role of the media in this the media must do a lot more to help in the fight we are still seeing on a massive scale the objectification of women in the media and an acceptance to continually use women as an object of property and sexuality addressing the issues of masculinity as a way of bringing men and young boys into the fight to end violence against women the brave man campaign is working with school and university boys and men throughout the country they encourage men of all ages to say no to any sorts of violence against women for further information on the brave man campaign please visit

stop crisis centre blast ain o shalish kendra for legal actions or talk to your doctor for medical and professional assistance after sexual abuse there is no particular way that a person who has experienced sexual abuse should behave people have individual ways of dealing with the various upheavals in ones lives and the changes in behaviour after such an experience is just that a normal human being reacting and coping in their own unique way it should be remembered that these behaviours does not signify any illness deficiencies or weakness and also the behaviour of such a person post trauma is the effect of various factors these factors include the survivors association with the perpetrator the extent and severity of accompanying physical abuse or psychological harm the grievousness of the abuse the degree of physical harm the duration of time over which the victim endured this abuse the support of family and friends of the survivor the womans experience of the various health and legal systems health police courts etc with which she may have contact following sexual abuse and the personal history of the survivor psychological effects of sexual abuse during the attack victims may experience intense fear of death dissociation common immediate and short term effects include anxiety and intense fear anything related to reminders of the attack e g legal steps or medical procedures being close to men or being in a location that reminds them of the attack fear of stds and or pregnancy fears of future attacks and other harm in some women this kind of abuse tend to reaffirmed their assumptions that they are not worthy of anything better most lose their trust and perceive the world as an unsafe and dangerous place medium to long term effects include low self esteem self blame and guilt for months and years denial of the incident ideas thoughts and even attempts of suicide interaction with social and community interpersonal relationships with spouses significant others as well as friendships and family relationships can all be affected following sexual abuse difficulties with communication intimacy trust specifically sexual relations and enjoyment of social activities can all be adversely affected women may particularly avoid social situations with men due to a heightened awareness of the potential for violence that some men are capable of work and life as a whole may be hindered due to the survivors limited allowance of interactions support from family and friends influence and aid the person in the road to recovery in great way society and sexual abuse many incidents of sexual abuse either not reported to the appropriate authorities or are much delayed this is because of the following causes the survivors fear the prejudice of the society in bangladeshs society where sex sexual abuse and the likes are somewhat of a taboo topic many people silently endure any such incident that they have undergone even if they do report it they do so at the very last moment when no other way is open to them it is sad but true that once the survivor reports any such incident they start being ostracised by the society either intentional or not relatives and family start to treat the survivor differently if his her name comes up in a conversation the incident is the first thing that everyone remembers about them whispered conversations regarding the survivor and his her behaviour takes place and their behaviour before the incident is criticized analysed and judged the survivor is eventually accused of having invited the unwanted attention by his her behaviour human beings are social beings so it is not surprising that that is why most people stay mum about such incidents each year in bangladesh thousands of children and young people are raped or sexually abused this includes children who have been abducted and trafficked or beaten threatened or bribed into having sex its important to understand what child sexual exploitation is and to be aware of warning signs that may indicate that a child you know is being exploited what is child sexual exploitation child sexual exploitation is when people use the power they have over young people to sexually abuse them their power may result from a difference in age gender intellect strength money or other resources people often think of child sexual exploitation in terms of serious organised crime but it also covers abuse within relationships and may involve informal exchanges of sex for something a child wants or needs such as accommodation gifts cigarettes or attention some children are groomed through boyfriends who then force the child or young person into having sex with friends or associates sexual abuse covers penetrative sexual acts sexual touching masturbation and misuse of sexual images for example on the internet or by mobile phone part of the challenge of tackling child sexual exploitation is that the children and young people involved may not understand that non consensual sex sex they havent agreed to or forced sex including oral sex is rape which children are affected any child or young person can be a victim of sexual exploitation but children are believed to be at greater risk of being sexually exploited if they are homeless have feelings of low self esteem have had a recent bereavement or loss are in care are a young carer however there are many more ways that a child may be vulnerable to sexual exploitation the signs of child sexual exploitation may be hard to spot particularly if a child is being threatened to make sure that children are protected its worth being aware of the signs that might suggest a child is being sexually exploited signs of grooming and child sexual exploitation signs of child sexual exploitation include the child or young person going missing for periods of time or regularly returning home late skipping school or being disruptive in class appearing with unexplained gifts or possessions that cant be accounted for experiencing health problems that may indicate a sexually transmitted infection having mood swings and changes in temperament using drugs and alcohol displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviours such as over familiarity with strangers dressing in a sexualised manner or sending sexualised images by mobile phone sexting they may also show signs of unexplained physical harm such as bruising and cigarette marks preventing abuse to protect children the advice is helping children understand their bodies and sex in a way that is appropriate to their age developing an open and trusting relationship so that they feel they can talk to you about anything explaining the difference between safe secrets such as a surprise party and unsafe secrets things that make them unhappy or uncomfortable teaching children to respect family boundaries such as privacy in sleeping dressing and bathing teaching them self respect and how to say no supervising internet and television use who is sexually exploiting children people of all backgrounds and ethnicities and of many different ages are involved in sexually exploiting children although most are male women are sometimes involved in befriending victims criminals can be hard to identify because the victims are often only given nicknames rather than the real name of the abuser some children and young people are sexually exploited by criminal gangs specifically set up for child sexual exploitation what to do if you suspect a child is being sexually exploited if you suspect that a child or young person has been or is being sexually exploited you should not confront the alleged abuser confronting them may place the child in greater physical danger and may give the abuser time to confuse or threaten them into silence instead seek professional advice such as the police or an independent organisation they may be able to provide advice on how to prevent further abuse and how to talk to your child to get an understanding of the situation if you know for certain that a child has been or is being sexually exploited report this directly to the police how common is child sexual exploitation a girl child is abused every one minute in bangladesh fahima nasrin vice president of bangladesh national women lawyers association bnwla said across the country about children work as commercial sex workers on the streets report by unnayan onneshan however the sexual abuse taking place in homes schools and public places is often shrouded in secrecy and the issue is mostly under reported due to social stigmas related to revelations the government of bangladesh and the government of denmark under the ministry of women and children affairs are jointly working together to end violence against women and children through the multi sectoral programme on violence against women one of the significant components of this project is the one stop crisis center occ which are present in all medical college hospitals across the country one stop crisis cells are present at district sadar and upazilla levels who co ordinate with the centers at medical college hospitals to send referred patients their main aim is to provide women with all medical legal and psychosocial support under one roof and for free of charge the services available are healthcare police assistance social service legal assistance psychosocial counselling shelter services another service available at occ is dna testing with the help of dna profiling from a biological sample blood semen saliva etc the identity of an individual victim suspected accused can be determined although other services are for free but this test costs tk per sample what do they do at an occ in the case of any form of abuse or violence all you have to do is reach at your nearest occ once you go to occ a doctor will take a detail history and do a thorough examination she will note down all the bruises new and old and fill up a form if you need admission you will be admitted at the occ ward samples for any necessary tests for example pregnancy test tests for stis etc will be collected and sent for examination you will then be referred to the psychosocial counsellor who will counsel you on your options you can always file a report and the rest will be taken care of by the police and legal services usually following an assault there is a mixed feeling and you might not know what to do right away this is when the counsellor steps in and helps you to decide what you want to do the occ ward is a restricted space where all entries are strictly monitored and recorded even doctors nurses are not allowed to enter unless it has been approved this ensures full safety and privacy of the victim the vaw helpline is for the victims of violence to get a guide to the service centers that will give them proper advice in recovering the shock of the incidence the helplines remain open hours most people in general do not know what to do where to go whom to consult to get an immediate help a set of telephone numbers may be helpful for the victims and their family members for getting proper guidance in getting access to justice one stop crisis centers helpline number is why will someone continue being in a relationship with a man who hits her lets her down and doesnt respect her why would she maintain two jobs to pay for rent and put food on the table while her man sits drinking all day if she didnt end it it was either her fault or she must have enjoyed it right once she ends such a relationship we say she didnt

elimination of violence against women new york united nations february resolution no a res if you know realise or suspect that a family member friend or work colleague is experiencing violence it may be difficult to decide what to do it may make you feel helpless and you may get very upset that someone is hurting a person you care about however dont try to intervene immediately or in a rash manner that may be dangerous for both you your friend and or her children however there are things that you can do to help for more details please see our section it is important to understand what someone experiencing violence is feeling for her emotional upheaval is inevitable so what really might an abused woman be feeling and experiencing extreme fear an abused woman may be mostly ruled by fear which can govern her every action a fear of more violence the unknown her own safety and the safety and well being of her children it is not wise to underestimate the effects of this kind of fear she may believe that she is at fault and that if she changes her own behaviour the abuse will eventually stop research has proven that that is definitely not the case she will most likely feel a myriad of emotions she may love her partner but despise the violence but still live with him in the hopes that his good side will reappear she may be dependent upon her partner both emotionally and financially she may experience feelings of low self esteem inconfident shame guilt and embarrassment she may feel resigned and hopeless in many cases this will make it hard for her to take decisions regarding her future so what can you do to support her try to talk to her and help her open up to you this may take several tries before she feels confident enough to tell you anything so dont get discouraged be straightforward beating around the bush will not help so start by saying something like im worried about you because or im concerned about your safety dont presume anything and definitely do not judge her listen to her and believe her when she tells you anything very often people dont believe a woman when she first talks about abuse not believing her might make her withdraw and think about enduring the abuse for longer this is dangerous reassure her tell her that this abuse is definitely not her fault and that you are always there for her no matter what dont try to insist that she leave the relationship or think less of her for staying in it although you may want whats best for her she will have to make that decision in her own it is important to remember that research shows an abused woman is at most risk at the point of separation and immediately after leaving an abusive partner leaving takes a great deal of strength and courage an abused woman often faces huge obstacles such as nowhere to go no money and no one to turn to for support concentrate on supporting her and help her rebuild her self confidence and self esteem appreciate her strengths and constantly remind her how well she is doing in situation as difficult as hers an abused woman is often very lonely and has no significant support help her to develop and maintain her contacts to the outside world friends family members and neighbours this can help to boost her self esteem if she has not spoken to anyone else encourage her to seek the help of a local domestic violence center like one stop crisis center occ or one stop crisis cell where they will understand what she is going through and offers medical and legal support and protection have patience and persist it can take time for a woman to recognise she is being abused and even longer to take be able to take safe and permanent decisions about what to do recognising the problem is an important first step how can you help to a woman whatever the state of her safety may be the safety of her child children is of utmost importance it is important to remember that so persuade her to think talk and make plans about how she and her children can be kept safe if when she plans to leave help her to stay safe agree on a code word or action that is only known to you both so she can signal somehow when she is in danger without alerting her abusive partner and cannot access help herself you then can seek help on her behalf from the respective authorities dont just dictate your plans for her instead encourage her to think about her safety more closely and focus on her own needs rather than his find out information about local services for her offer to keep spare sets of keys or important documents such as passports birth certificates national id cards educational certificates cash jewellery and things she may deem important in a safe place for her so that she can access them quickly if she is in an emergency situation help her to think of ways in which she can increase the safety of her children remember that it isnt childrens responsibility to protect their mother however they could be trained in a way such that in an emergency they could go to a neighbour or a relative or someone they trust any kind of repeated harassing or threatening behaviour towards another person is called stalking the person stalking can be

he was very charming and was always sending me cards it seemed odd but he explained it was because he liked watching me in hindsight i realise he did it so he could see what i was wearing before long he started asking why i bothered putting on make up he told me that i was beautiful and perfect without it then he began laying out my clothes for me it was his way of being able to choose what i wore name calling then violence after two months he began to wait for me outside work if i didnt come out immediately hed get angry he accused me of staying late so i could flirt with other men he said that he only waited because he loved me he became moody and would start rows hed call me names and mock my accent a little voice in the back of my head kept saying youre not happy but i tried to ignore it i always seemed to be on the phone to golam explaining what i was doing even though i was sometimes up at am for my job he expected his dinner to be on the table when he came in from work gradually he became the most important thing in my life the only thing in my life i had less and less contact with family and friends one day when we were bickering golam pushed me onto the floor finally i stood up to him and told him he couldnt treat me that way that people go to prison for behaving like that he laughed called me a liability then rang the police he told them that we had been having a row and i was planning to call them the next day to say he had hit me so as to cause trouble for him i felt really scared as id never been in that situation before i was embarrassed and shocked and didnt know what to do hitting spitting humiliation after this incident the violence became a regular occurrence in our relationship one time he broke my finger and i had to see a hand specialist on another occasion i went to emergency with bruising to my head face and body he spat at me pushed me kicked me and bit me once he even tried to run me over after each bout of violence he would tenderly rub cream on my skin and tell me he was my protector i began to feel that i was going mad the degradation was harder to cope with than the violence i became so insecure and unsure of what was right or wrong by my own standards never mind legally that i allowed many things to happen that i never would have before golam would make me beg on my knees if i wanted something or hed throw money on the pavement and order me to pick it up leaving and regaining confidence i became convinced i was ugly when we went out golam would blatantly stare at women in front of me then if i complained tell me that i was imagining it bit by bit my sense of reason and self esteem evaporated he became more and more controlling he even told my mum to contact me only through his mobile because it was easier each night he would search my bag and check the mileage on my car he would take pictures of me as i was walking around the house or when i was sobbing after an argument i finally left golam after he attacked me with a corkscrew it took me a long time to build up my confidence again especially as he continued to harass me long after i left him he had completely crushed my self worth my career as a teacher which had been going from strength to strength before i met him really suffered with the support of my friends family i was able to rebuild my life and confidence i have worked hard to get back on track and im doing really well at work now most importantly i know my own mind again this unfortunately is not a unique story this unfortunately is not a made up story this story resonates with innumerable women in bangladesh both in urban and rural areas rich or poor educated or socially vulnerable whos multi country study on womens health and domestic violence against women shows that more than percent of women in urban areas of bangladesh have been subjected to intimate partner violence ipv intimate partner violence has been directly shown to result to systematic and recurrent physical abuse which leads to severe emotional distress depression and suicidal behavior there are several instances of ipv occurring during womens pregnancies or post antenatal stages causing further physical and emotional harm to both mother and child ipv in bangladesh is usually seen through the focus of domestic violence which does not usually take into consideration instances of young couples in consenting relationships and therefore the abuse and violence that occurs in these relations there is also far greater stigma around young women and girls in relationships before marriage which leads to silencing of any form of abuse that may happen among partners anyone who has been sexually assaulted or abused by their partners can get confidential help treatment and support

comment child marriage is a serious issue in south asia and particularly in bangladesh which has the highest rate in this region over one third of women aged between were married by the age of and were married before the age of bbs report on vaw this is not just a systematic violation of womens rights but it is also a huge obstacle to economic and human development in bangladesh girls are often married off early with the aim of minimising dowry costs moreover parents often believe that early marriage will protect their daughters from sexual harassment a belief for which there is absolutely no evidence the consequences are devastating and manifold girls who marry early generally drop out of school which instantly reduces their economic independence and restricts their social status and mobility lack of education also affects their health and that of their children as children of educated mothers are less likely to suffer from malnutrition girls who marry as children are susceptible to a myriad of health risks due to other reasons too they tend to experience early sexual initiation and childbearing which expose them to many physical problems including fistula sexually transmitted diseases and complications at birth they are also more likely to experience domestic violence and rape with the associated psychological implications child marriage is not simply a violation of the individual rights of women it also reflects and perpetuates a culture where women are constantly undervalued treated as sexual objects and denied any sort of power over their own lives the problem is that by taking women out of school so early on they are kept uneducated uninformed about their rights and thus powerless and when they have their own daughters these women are often active participants in continuing the trend and encouraging them to marry early to break this cycle it is important that women have access to information and that they receive support to make their own free empowered decisions this is not to say that men dont play an important role in the fight for equal rights but once women are aware and sensitized about this issue they will support their daughters in making their own decisions too gradually breaking the cycle when reshma from a rural village called harirampur found out at that she was going to be married off to a year old man from a nearby village she was devastated and begged her father to change his mind it was not after reshmas mother began mobilising villagers and local stakeholders in the community that reshmas father gave in finally understanding that child marriage is illegal and unfair reshmas mother had become aware about the dangers of child marriage by being a member of a reflective action group organised by actionaid through this group she learnt information about child marriage and she built a network with other women who supported her as she defended her daughters rights child marriage is a threat to bangladeshi society in many fronts it has been illegal since but this has done nothing to stop it the only way to break the cycle is to raise awareness about the dangers of the practice and to empower women to make their own considered decisions through providing accessible information to both online and offline communities and mobilising a network of women for collective action and support despite the minimum age of girls to get married being in every girl in a developing country is married before her th birthday there are multiple reasons for such a high rate of child marriage in bangladesh strong unchallenged patriarchal norms many parents think that marrying off their daughters early would mean less dowry as the dowry increases with the girls ages by finding an appropriate groom they believe they are securing their childs future but they completely ignore the emotional and psychological effects these have in the wellbeing of the girl although there has been a decline in child marriage stats over the past decades the rate is slow and issues are still not addressed properly child marriage denies a girl of her right to education and the ability to have an economic stability it disconnects them with their family and leaves them to deal with marriage parenthood and domestic duties alone they do not have any control over their choices and are more subjected to domestic violence since the male partner usually much older than the girl dominates the family he is responsible for making the decisions on behalf the girl is deprived of her sexual and reproductive rights most of the girls married before years of age describe their first sexual experience as forced if she gets pregnant the decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy is taken by her husband or other members of the family she is also deprived of her rights to contraception and family planning the husband decides the form of contraception used and in case of unwanted pregnancy unsafe unhygienic methods are applied to terminate pregnancy without any professional medical advice or supervision at maya apa ki bolen we get questions where a years old has carried out abortion at home twice since she got married at the age of because her family believed she isnt ready for childbirth child marriage also puts the girl at risk of a early pregnancy at a time when her body is still not prepared to go through childbearing there are continuous pregnancies without much gap between two childbirths in a country such as bangladesh where undernutrition is a huge problem these underweight teenage girls are unable to go through childbirth without facing pregnancy related complications young teenage girls are more likely to die of pregnancy related causes than girls who are pregnant in their s early child bearing means she suffers from conditions such as iron deficiency anaemia high blood pressure pre eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and depression the mortality is higher during childbirth when they have to go through labour upto of adolescent mothers suffer from obstetric fistula as a complication of normal labour early childbearing is also related to the high maternal mortality rate there is a much higher chance of perinatal and infant mortality stillbirth preterm births and birth of low weight babies the babies are undernourished more vulnerable to diseases and die within first month of birth even the baby survives there is delayed development of milestones lack of basic education means that the mother is unaware of child nutrition and babycare addressing these issues and raising awareness against child marriage can help us fight maternal and child mortality it is not about educating the girls but families and society as a whole the law that binds upon the religion islam is shariah law it prescribes muslim behavior in every aspect of life from private matters between the individual and god to relationships with others from the family or the widest community the law is casted from the actions and words of the quran the holy book sunnah what is said by prophet mohammad sbh ijma communal legislation made by great scholars and qiyas permissible exegesis the shariah contains categories and subjects of islamic law called the branches of fiqh literally understanding they include islamic worship family relations inheritance commerce property law civil tort law criminal law administration taxation constitution international relations war and ethics and other categories in order to protect womens right several laws also exist and some have been enacted in our country but no law contradict with the shariah first of all we should go through the article of the constitution of the peoples republic of bangladesh where it has very clearly stated that women shall have equal right with men in all spheres of state and of public life and it has again stated in that nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of society so it is clear that womens right have been guaranteed by our constitution though in muslim family law ordinance or in other law womens rights have been guaranteed but there are some problems arising at the time of enforcement it is a very important question that after enacting some laws in order to protect the rights of women whether women can implement their rights there are many reports pointing out that women often face difficulty in pursuing their rights within the legal system due to the lack of implementation of laws against murder rape assault child marriage and many other abuses social norms tend to ostracize female victims rather than perpetrators of crimes i would like to emphasize the important issue of registration we often miss out during the whole shenanigans during and after marriage this one act decides whether or not the woman in the marriage will likely get any recourse from law if and when she needs it it has clearly been stated in section of the muslim marriages and divorces registration act that notwithstanding anything contained in any law custom or usage every marriage solemnized under muslim law shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of this act inspite of this mandatory legal requirement huge number of marriages are solemnizing without any registration in the city as well as in the rural areas as a result if any dispute arises in their conjugal life women cannot go to the court for implementing her right since the marriage was not duly registered on the other hand many marriages are being conducted court where as there is no such marriage like court marriage court marriage is nothing except a form of an affidavit where both parties sign and agree to marry each other after swearing the affidavit many of the couple do not register their marriage in order to save their money again when the right of the woman is violated and she has no other alternative but to seek help from the court she cannot enforce her eight due to failure of registration all our readers are advised to ensure that they have their contract of marriage registered buy

now no longer permissible in law in most developed countries after being encouraged by patriarchy for millennia to mistreat women men are now expected to change their oppressive behaviour almost overnight with little support for change from the state luke daniels domestic violence consultant and author of pulling the punches defeating domestic violence the root cause of men abusing women can be linked to the primitive instinct of men to prove that he is stronger than women the world has followed a patriarch system from the beginning of time men are physically stronger than women so they should go out to work while the vulnerable and fragile women must stay at home nursing kids and taking care of the household this unfortunately remains the premise in strong patriarchal societies such as that in bangladesh a boy is taught that he is superior than a girl at a very early age he almost always gets a special treatment compared to his sister he is called a girl whenever he shows any weakness or emotion this gives the boy only one lesson that a girl is weak being a girl is a matter of joke be made fun of that girls are always beneath boys these ideas of masculinity and femininity continues throughout adulthood where relationships between husband and wife are also dictated by these notions of what a woman is suppose to do and should be doing compounded with socio cultural beliefs and sayings that in many instances are not necessarily religiously sound but claimed to be from religious referrals women are made to believe and are therefore treated as the weaker sex the second class citizen a new done specifically on men of asia and the pacifics have stated that education and awareness on gender equality is an effective way of stopping violence against women interviewing over men at various sites of bangladesh sri lanka indonesia china has revealed several factors that came up repeatedly as to why men abuse women it showed that abusive men try to control their partner in every possible way believe in male superiority over female like to show off their male toughness and sexuality have grown up seeing abuse of women esp mother as a normal occurrence have a history of abuse be it physical mental or sexual to stop abuse we need to be encouraging men to participate and be pro actively engaged in womens rights to stand up and fight for women there is a great fear by men and boys that to get involved in womens rights somehow reduces their masculinity and makes them appear emotional weak or feminine these perceptions need to be changed men also need to be shown that they do not need to be scared of empowered or educated women or womens equality in general ensuring greater empowerment and education of girls and women are not threats but opportunities for both the sexes in a patriarchal society men are used to being in control and the release of that control and hence realizing the unknown makes many men very uneasy this needs to be eliminated to prevent violence against women the study recommends making violence against women totally unacceptable eg through awareness programmes using socially recognized and influential people like actors cricketers etc educate men about ways to show their musculinity other than abusing women eg through sustained school based or sports based education programmes address child abuse and promote healthy families eg through parenting programmes comprehensive child protection systems and policies work with young people with a particular focus on boys and adolescents to understand consent and healthy sex respectful relationships end immunity for men who use violence against women particularly marital rape through criminalization of all forms of violence against women and ensure fast legal action to ensure effective access to justice and ensure the full empowerment of women and girls and eliminate gender discrimination another important agenda that must be looked into is the role of the media in this the media must do a lot more to help in the fight we are still seeing on a massive scale the objectification of women in the media and an acceptance to continually use women as an object of property and sexuality addressing the issues of masculinity as a way of bringing men and young boys into the fight to end violence against women the brave man campaign is working with school and university boys and men throughout the country they encourage men of all ages to say no to any sorts of violence against women for further information on the brave man campaign please visit

trauma is the effect of various factors these factors include the survivors association with the perpetrator the extent and severity of accompanying physical abuse or psychological harm the grievousness of the abuse the degree of physical harm the duration of time over which the victim endured this abuse the support of family and friends of the survivor the womans experience of the various health and legal systems health police courts etc with which she may have contact following sexual abuse and the personal history of the survivor psychological effects of sexual abuse during the attack victims may experience intense fear of death dissociation common immediate and short term effects include anxiety and intense fear anything related to reminders of the attack e g legal steps or medical procedures being close to men or being in a location that reminds them of the attack fear of stds and or pregnancy fears of future attacks and other harm in some women this kind of

way society and sexual abuse many incidents of sexual abuse either not reported to the appropriate authorities or are much delayed this is because of the following causes the survivors fear the prejudice of the society in bangladeshs society where sex sexual abuse and the likes are somewhat of a taboo topic many people silently endure any such incident that they have undergone even if they do report it they do so at the very last moment when no other way is open to them it is sad but true that once the survivor reports any such incident they start being ostracised by the society either intentional or not relatives and family start to treat the survivor differently if his her name comes up in a conversation the incident is the first thing that everyone remembers about them whispered conversations regarding the survivor and his her behaviour takes place and their behaviour before the incident is criticized analysed and judged the survivor is eventually accused of having invited the unwanted attention by his her behaviour human beings are social beings so it is not surprising that that is why most people stay mum about such incidents each year in bangladesh thousands of children and young people are raped or sexually abused this includes children who have been abducted and trafficked or beaten threatened or bribed into having sex its important to understand what child sexual exploitation is and to be aware of warning signs that may indicate that a child you know is being exploited what is child sexual exploitation child sexual exploitation is when people use the power they have over young people to sexually abuse them their power may result from a difference in age gender intellect strength money or other resources people often think of child sexual exploitation in terms of serious organised crime but it also covers abuse within relationships and may involve informal exchanges of sex for something a child wants or needs such as accommodation gifts cigarettes or attention some children are groomed through boyfriends who then force the child or young person into having sex with friends or associates sexual abuse covers penetrative sexual acts sexual touching masturbation and misuse of sexual images for example on the internet or by mobile phone part of the challenge of tackling child sexual exploitation is that the children and young people involved may not understand that non consensual sex sex they havent agreed to or forced sex including oral sex is rape which children are affected any child or young person can be a victim of sexual exploitation but children are believed to be at greater risk of being sexually exploited if they are homeless have feelings of low self esteem have had a recent bereavement or loss are in care are a young carer however there are many more ways that a child may be vulnerable to sexual exploitation the signs of child sexual exploitation may be hard to spot particularly if a child is being threatened to make sure that children are protected its worth being aware of the signs that might suggest a child is being sexually exploited signs of grooming and child sexual exploitation signs of child sexual exploitation include the child or young person going missing for periods of time or regularly returning home late skipping school or being disruptive in class appearing with unexplained gifts or possessions that cant be accounted for experiencing health problems that may indicate a sexually transmitted infection having mood swings and changes in temperament using drugs and alcohol displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviours such as over familiarity with strangers dressing in a sexualised manner or sending sexualised images by mobile phone sexting they may also show signs of unexplained physical harm such as bruising and cigarette marks preventing abuse to protect children the advice is helping children understand their bodies and sex in a way that is appropriate to their age developing an open and trusting relationship so that they feel they can talk to you about anything explaining the difference between safe secrets such as a surprise party and unsafe secrets things that make them unhappy or uncomfortable teaching children to respect family boundaries such as privacy in sleeping dressing and bathing teaching them self respect and how to say no supervising internet and television use who is sexually exploiting children people of all backgrounds and ethnicities and of many different ages are involved in sexually exploiting children although most are male women are sometimes involved in befriending victims criminals can be hard to identify because the victims are often only given nicknames rather than the real name of the abuser some children and young people are sexually exploited by criminal gangs specifically set up for child sexual exploitation what to do if you suspect a child is being sexually exploited if you suspect that a child or young person has been or is being sexually exploited you should not confront the alleged abuser confronting them may place the child in greater physical danger and may give the abuser time to confuse or threaten them into silence instead seek professional advice such as the police or an independent organisation they may be able to provide advice on how to prevent further abuse and how to talk to your child to get an understanding of the situation if you know for certain that a child has been or is being sexually exploited report this directly to the police how common is child sexual exploitation a girl child is abused every one minute in bangladesh fahima nasrin vice president of bangladesh national women lawyers association bnwla said across the country about children work as commercial sex workers on the streets report by unnayan onneshan however the sexual abuse taking place in homes schools and public places is often shrouded in secrecy and the issue is mostly under reported due to social stigmas related to revelations the government of bangladesh and the government of denmark under the ministry of women and children affairs are jointly working together to end violence against women and children through the multi sectoral programme on violence against women one of the significant components of this project is the one stop crisis center occ which are present in all medical college hospitals across the country one stop crisis cells are present at district sadar and upazilla levels who co ordinate with the centers at medical college hospitals to send referred patients their main aim is to provide women with all medical legal and psychosocial support under one roof and for free of charge the services available are healthcare police assistance social service legal assistance psychosocial counselling shelter services another service available at occ is dna testing with the help of dna profiling from a biological sample blood semen saliva etc the identity of an individual victim suspected accused can be determined although other services are for free but this test costs tk per sample what do they do at an occ in the case of any form of abuse or violence all you have to do is reach at your nearest occ once you go to occ a doctor will take a detail history and do a thorough examination she will note down all the bruises new and old and fill up a form if you need admission you will be admitted at the occ ward samples for any necessary tests for example pregnancy test tests for stis etc will be collected and sent for examination you will then be referred to the psychosocial counsellor who will counsel you on your options you can always file a report and the rest will be taken care of by the police and legal services usually following an assault there is a mixed feeling and you might not know what to do right away this is when the counsellor steps in and helps you to decide what you want to do the occ ward is a restricted space where all entries are strictly monitored and recorded even doctors nurses are not allowed to enter unless it has been approved this ensures full safety and privacy of the victim the vaw helpline is for the victims of violence to get a guide to the service centers that will give them proper advice in recovering the shock of the incidence the helplines remain open hours most people in general do not know what to do where to go whom to consult to get an immediate help a set of telephone numbers may be helpful for the victims and their family members for getting proper guidance in getting access to justice one stop crisis centers helpline number is why will someone continue being in a relationship with a man who hits her lets her down and doesnt respect her why would she maintain two jobs to pay for rent and put food on the table while her man sits drinking all day if she didnt end it it was either her fault or she must have enjoyed it right once she ends such a relationship we say she didnt try hard enough to fix things she should have thought about her childs future she should have tried to sober him up she shouldnt have argued with him so what is it that makes them continue such relationships have you ever thought before passing a judgement or making a comment or contributing to the gossip here are few of your questions answered and yes they do make sense what makes you think that this is a healthy relationship and abuses are normal my father beat my mom it just goes with being in a relationship getting hit isnt the worst thing that can happen in a family i know of worse

me to work id rather die than be on welfare my partner forces me to work and then takes all my money my partner charges up all my credit cards my partner cant work he depends on me to support him victim blaming is easy and but why someone chooses to be in a relationship or end it is entirely their decision the reason why someone continue to be with her abuser is far more complex than her upbringing strength of will and not having a support whatever it is we are no one to judge because we are the reason our culture sends the message that a womans value depends on her being in a relationship women without partners tend to be devalued by the society we tell them it is their male partner that keep them together you have to have a man by your side and cannot survive in the world alone we should encourage them to decide when it is an appropriate time and how to carry out that decision many victims do not even know that it is okay to leave there are reasons to leave and there are reasons to stay too do not judge help break the cycle of abuse find out how you can help them do not impose your opinion wait for them to realise and then come to you for help there are several

extensive suffering and negative health consequences for a significant proportion of the female population more than in most countries it has a direct negative impact on several important health issues including safe motherhood family planning and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv aids for many women who have been abused health workers are the main and often the only point of contact with public services which may be able to offer support and information world bank world development report investing in health new york oxford university press declaration on the elimination of violence against women new york united nations february resolution no a res if you know realise or suspect that a family member friend or work colleague is experiencing violence it may be difficult to decide what to do it may make you feel helpless and you may get very upset that someone is hurting a person you care about however dont try to intervene immediately or in a rash manner that may be dangerous for both you your friend and or her children however there are things that you can do to help for more details please see our section it is important to understand what someone experiencing violence is feeling for her emotional upheaval is inevitable so what really might an abused woman be feeling and experiencing extreme fear an abused woman may be mostly ruled by fear which can govern her every action a fear of more violence the unknown her own safety and the safety and well being of her children it is not wise to underestimate the effects of this kind of fear she may believe that she is at fault and that if she changes her own behaviour the abuse will eventually stop research has proven that that is definitely not the case she will most likely feel a myriad of emotions she may love her partner but despise the violence but still live with him in the hopes that his good side will reappear she may be dependent upon her partner both emotionally and financially she may experience feelings of low self esteem inconfident shame guilt and embarrassment she may feel resigned and hopeless in many cases this will make it hard for her to take decisions regarding her future so what can you do to support her try to talk to her and help her open up to you this may take several tries before she feels confident enough to tell you anything so dont get discouraged be straightforward beating around the bush will not help so start by saying something like im worried about you because or im concerned about your safety dont presume anything and definitely do not judge her listen to her and believe her when she tells you anything very often people dont believe a woman when she first talks about abuse not believing her might make her withdraw and think about enduring the abuse for longer this is dangerous reassure her tell her that this abuse is definitely not her fault and that you are always there for her no matter what dont try to insist that she leave the relationship or think less of her for staying in it although you may want whats best for her she will have to make that decision in her own it is important to remember that research shows an abused woman is at most risk at the point of separation and immediately after leaving an abusive partner leaving takes a great deal of strength and courage an abused woman often faces huge obstacles such as nowhere to go no money and no one to turn to for support concentrate on supporting her and help her rebuild her self confidence and self esteem appreciate her strengths and constantly remind her how well she is doing in situation as difficult as hers an abused woman is often very lonely and has no significant support help her to develop and maintain her contacts to the outside world friends family members and neighbours this can help to boost her self esteem if she has not spoken to anyone else encourage her to seek the help of a local domestic violence center like one stop crisis center occ or one stop crisis cell where they will understand what she is going through and offers medical and legal support and protection have patience and persist it can take time for a woman to recognise she is being abused and even longer to take be able to take safe and permanent decisions about what to do recognising the problem is an important first step how can you help to a woman whatever the state of her safety may be the safety of her child children is of utmost importance it is important to remember that so persuade her to think talk and make plans about how she and her children can be kept safe if when she plans to leave help her to stay safe agree on a code word or action that is only known to you both so she can signal somehow when she is in danger without alerting her abusive partner and cannot access help herself you then can seek help on her behalf from the respective authorities dont just dictate your plans for her instead encourage her to think about her safety more closely and focus on her own needs rather than his find out information about local services for her offer to keep spare sets of keys or important documents such as passports birth certificates national id cards educational certificates cash jewellery and things she may deem important in a safe place for her so that she can access them quickly if she is in an emergency situation help her to think of ways in which she can increase the safety of her children remember that it isnt childrens responsibility to protect their mother however they could be trained in a way such that in an emergency they could go to a neighbour or a relative or someone they trust any kind of repeated harassing or threatening behaviour towards another person is called stalking the person stalking can be
